I had not created a website in 7 years, and was rusty in coding and administration. I was a relatively good website full stack developer for someone who was self taught, but a poor administrator, with websites being lost due to hosting providers deleting the sites and databases.&nbsp;</p><p>I first looked at an off the shelf website creator such as Square Space. I really like Square Space and feel that the online website design tools are effective in building sites quickly that look visually appealing. I had 3 major apprehensions:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>It does not look professional, or encourage people to download your app if you have a Square Space footer on your website.&nbsp;</li><li>It would be harder to add more functionality later on driven from the API</li><li>It is quite expensive if the site doesn't take off</li></ul><p>Ultimately for me, if this was about spinning up a business quickly, I would have overcome these apprehensions, and dealt with the consequences down the line. This however is a passion project, and therefore I have the time to do things right, and learn whilst I do them.</p><h2 id="jamstack">JAMSTACK</h2><p>To the earlier point around administration, I wanted to avoid purchasing a physical server. It is expensive, difficult to manage and only has dis-benefits. I have been keen on a JAMSTACK website, as there are major cost, configuration and management benefits. Azure Files (and alternatives) are also good, but ultimately add complexity into the design without driving functionality.</p><p>Building from scratch a HTML/CSS/Javascript website that support JAMSTACK principles is relatively easy. However I was keen to look at a headless CMS to be able to easier manage content and ensure that others could update the website if needed at a later date.</p><p>There are many open source free options for headless CMS, with Umbraco being a clear leader for enterprise websites. I however decided on Publii which is unique in being a desktop CMS. As the website will only be updated (at the moment) by a small number of people, it is easier to install a desktop client and share the files across Dropbox/OneDrive than setup and administer an Umbraco installation. In the future, as the needs grow, it may be necessary to move to such a platform, but that won't be a problem for a long time.</p><h2 id="publii">Publii</h2><p>Publii added more work on the development, as unless you are willing to use one of their templates (which aren't great!), you will need to code HTML/CSS/Javascript bottom up, and then the complexity of calling data from the CMS. I really like the way Publii works to bring the site and compile together. The major downside is the lack of concept of pages and is clearly built for blog posts. This is frustrating, but in consideration there are two types of pages - static webpages that convey information, and functionality webpages that do something.&nbsp;</p><p>The posts function works well to turn the post into a static webpage. Functionality webpages are always going to need code added, so instead these pages were created separately within the template and configuration was added to the Theme to be able to tweak as needed. This is a fairly nice solution, but does add the problem that the Theme is largely unusable if you want to use it for a different project with different needs.</p><p></p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on August 28, 2022</p><div class="post__share-tag-container"><div class="post__tag"><h3>Tagged in:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://ourrecipe.app/tags/website/">Website</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button icon" aria-label="Share button"><i class="fas fa-share-alt"></i></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fourrecipe.app%2Fdesigning-our-website%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-facebook-f" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fourrecipe.app%2Fdesigning-our-website%2F&amp;via=%40JamesCarne&amp;text=Designing%20our%20Website" class="js-share icon brands fa-twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fourrecipe.app%2Fdesigning-our-website%2F&amp;media=undefined&amp;description=Designing%20our%20Website" class="js-share icon brands fa-pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Pinterest</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fourrecipe.app%2Fdesigning-our-website%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://buffer.com/add?text=Designing%20our%20Website&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fourrecipe.app%2Fdesigning-our-website%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-buffer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Buffer</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Designing%20our%20Website https%3A%2F%2Fourrecipe.app%2Fdesigning-our-website%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div></footer></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>Developed with love from the UKÂ <img id="countrylogo" src="media/files/UKFlagSmall.jpeg"></li><li>Privacy Policy</li><li>Contact Us</li></ul></footer></div><script src="https://ourrecipe.app/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=7c14a783dfeb3d238ccd3edd840d82ee"></script><script src="https://ourrecipe.app/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://ourrecipe.app/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://ourrecipe.app/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://ourrecipe.app/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://ourrecipe.app/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://ourrecipe.app/assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
